# Covid-19-Sanitization-Tunnel
A tunnel that will spray Sanitizer to the person going through it. This tunnel is simulated using Proteus Software.
This project was made in mind considering the danger of Covid-19 and the increasing number of patients.This help in 
spraying sanitizer without human to human contact. A person entering the tunnel will get sanitized without any manual
control. This reduces the risk of human contact.

Working:-
When a person enters the tunnel,gets detected by the ultrasonic sensors. This causes the DC motor to start spraying the sanitizer.There is an LCD display that shows
a person is in the tunnel and asks the person behind him to wait.Also a RED LED will start indicating the person behind to wait.A RF module is also present in the system that will wirelessly inform the operator.When the tunnel is empty the LCD will display that the tunnel is empty the person can pass.A GREEN LED will burn indiacting the same also the operator will also be informed about the tunnel being empty.

Components used:-
01) Arduino UNO
02) Ultrasonic Sensor (HSCR04)
03) MOSFET (IRF540)
04) LCD (16x4)
05) RF Module
06) Virtual Terminal
07) Water Pump
08) LED (Green and Red)
09) Resistors(1K and 10K)
10) Battery
